## Mock Store

### Technologies used:
SCSS, React (Next.Js), GraphQL, Node.js, FontAwesome

### Demo:
https://mock-store-delta.vercel.app/

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Overview:

Simple product page and mini using Mock Shop API. You should be able to add products to the cart as well as view it, update the number of items in the cart and with the context provider you will be able to view it across multiple pages if they were to be added.

Improvements I would have made:
- Optimized the images (perhaps utilizing webpack)
- Made the cards and other sections of the page responsive.
- Made it so if you added multiple of the same item in the cart then the number of items on the cart icon would correspond with that.
- Adding colour variants to each item.
